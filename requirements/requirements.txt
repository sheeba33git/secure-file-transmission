Excellent! Now that you can see all UI features (including "View Blockchain Logs") and your file upload is working, here’s a checklist to ensure your Secure File Transmission project is fully functional and interview-ready.

Final Functionality Checklist
1. Registration and Login
Can a new user successfully register?

Can both “user” and “admin” roles be registered and logged in?

Does the site block login with wrong credentials?

2. Dashboard and Upload
After login, does the dashboard display the welcome message and secure file features?

Can users choose and upload files?

Do successfully uploaded files show up instantly in the “Your Files” table?

Does the table show the correct Uploader and Timestamp?

3. Download Feature
Can users download files they have uploaded?

If you log in as a different user, do they only see/download their own files? (Unless "admin", which should see all.)

4. Role-based Access
Does an admin account see all files and the Blockchain Logs link?

Does a regular user see only their uploads, and (if coded) never see the Blockchain Logs link?

5. Blockchain Logging
Click “View Blockchain Logs.” Does it display a readable, recent log of file upload/download events?

Are new actions (uploads/downloads) added as new blocks to the chain?

6. Error Handling
Try wrong inputs, forbidden routes, or uploading without a file—do you see your professional error pages (404, 500, etc.)?

Are all error links/buttons and navigation clearly visible?

7. UI Consistency
All navigation (“Back to Home”, “View Blockchain Logs”, and “Go to My Files”) is visible and styled.

Font Awesome icons render correctly.

Register/Login navigation is clear and works from both forms.

Optional Nice-to-Have Checks
Test resizing your browser: Is the interface still readable? (Mobile-friendly is a bonus!)

Try to upload the same file twice: Does your app handle this gracefully?

Check your uploads/ directory: Are your files safely saved there?

Try logging in as BOTH admin and user to confirm permissions.

Logout and try protected routes: Do you get redirected to login?

If all these features work as intended, your project is not only working but ready to impress in interviews or demonstrations!
If you run into a problem with any specific step or want to upgrade/add a feature, just ask!
